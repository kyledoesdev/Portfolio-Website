                        I entered the Software Engineering industry in June of 2020 while I was finishing my
                        sophomore year of university during the Covid-19 pandemic. As the pandemic started, I used
                        the spare time I found to begin to teach myself basic HTML, CSS & Javascript and made some
                        pretty bad beginner websites. (Including this one!) I continued to practice & learn other scripting languages like php & python.
                        A few months later, I was offered a position as a Software Engineer through a friend I had met in school.

                    <p class="mt-4">
                        I worked part time at Delivery Circle while I contined my degree from June of 2020 until
                        Feburary 2022 when I was let go from company. During my time there, I became more familiar
                        with several different technologies including PHP, Laravel, JQuery, MySQL & more. I worked on
                        several projects with the largest being an order payout for drivers.

                    <p class="mt-4">
                        After leaving Delivery Circle, I was hired shortly after by Retail Insights LLC. At Retail Insights,
                        I've lead & collaberteed on internal and client facing tools. Some of those projects include
                        Consumer & Rx drug pricing, promotion and deal bidding, tradeshow registration systems,
                        new supplier setup & submission, compliance form handling and more. At Retail Insights, I've mastered 
                        tools like Laravel, Livewire, JQuery, SASS, Vue Js, MySql, AWS Modules and more.
